# Skill Sharpening Project Two


<img src="./assets/sharpen.webp" alt="Sharpening" width="500">

## Project Description
This project is a series of exercises to help you sharpen your basic JavaScript skills.

Each file in the `src` folder focuses on a different data structure and a different goal.

Work through each problem one at a time. Only use LLMs to help you understand the problem. Not give you the solution.
It should always only be a learning tool.

As a programmer, as you get better, you should be able to solve these problems without using LLMs as you will be asked to do in professional interviews.

## Getting Started

1. `Fork` the repository
2. `Clone` the repository
3. `cd` into the project directory
4. `npm install` to install the dependencies
6. Write the code in the `src` directory files
7. Check the jest tests to see if you passed
8. Commit your changes and push to your repository

## Running the Tests

1. `npm test` to run all of the tests
2. Seeing all of the tests may be overwhelming, so you can run `npm test <filename>` to run a specific test file. (e.g. `npm test 01-array-basics.test.js`)
3. You can also run `npm test <number>` to run the test for one specific file. (e.g. `npm test 1`)
