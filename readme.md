# Skill Sharpening Project Two

## Project Description

When learning a new skill, it is crucial to practice it over and over again. This project is a series of exercises to help you sharpen your basic JavaScript skills. The files will range in difficulty, but all will require you to reproduce skills you've just learned.

Each file in the `src` folder focuses on a different data structure and a different goal.

Work through each problem one at a time. Only use LLMs to help you understand the problem. Not give you the solution.
It should always only be a learning tool.

As a programmer, as you get better, you should be able to solve these problems without using LLMs as you will be asked to do in professional interviews.

## Project scoring

This project is only based on **completion.** To complete a file, all of the tests associated with that file must pass. Each file you complete is worth 1 point. If you complete no test for that file, you will receive 0 points. If some tests pass for that file, you will receive 0.5 points.

## Getting Started

1. `Fork` the repository
2. `Clone` the repository
3. `cd` into the project directory
4. `npm install` to install the dependencies
6. Write the code in the `src` directory files
7. Check the jest tests to see if you passed
8. Commit your changes and push to your repository

## Running the Tests

1. `npm test` to run all of the tests
2. Viewing all of the tests at once may be overwhelming. If you want to run a specific test file instead, run `npm test <filename>`  (e.g. `npm test 01-array-basics.test.js`)
3. To view tests for a specific file, you can also simplify the command by runnings `npm test <number>` to run the test for one specific file. (e.g. `npm test 1`)
